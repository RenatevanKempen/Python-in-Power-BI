# Python in Power BI 

Hello to you all!

My name is Renate van Kempen and in this repo you will find all kind of examples of the use of Python in Power BI. 

## Why should I use Python in Power BI? 
If you are a data professional and enjoy building Power BI dashboards, you might not think of using Python.

Allow me to give you some reasons why Python can be of added value: 
1. Transforming and cleaning data via Python is a lot faster and there are more (endless!!) possibilities
2. Python visualizations can be used in your dashboard, there are more visualizations possible than Power BI standard has. 
3. Use a Python script to make predictions on your dataset

And note, Python is open source, so completely free of charge, you do not need a premium license!

Want to learn more about predicting with Python in Power BI, be sure to check out this course. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via [email](renate@baime.nl)

Kind Regards, Renate
